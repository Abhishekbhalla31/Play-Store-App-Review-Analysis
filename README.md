# Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis
An analysis of the Google Playstore is presented by me. Almabetter Team provided the project with the datasets. User reviews and Playstore data analysis make up two of the datasets. This project was chosen in order to gain insight into the apps domain utilised in Android mobile devices and tablets. It is a difficult task.The research began with the concept of Playstore analysis and uploading both datasets. In order to extract the correct data from the datasets, we first cleaned them and made the necessary alterations. After all of this, we had the correct understanding of the project's objectives.In this project, we took 10 goals from the first dataset and 6 goals from the second. We have examined each goal and given it the right organisation and imagery, which has allowed us to achieve our goals. The findings we had seen via our work were then used to end our project.

The project's findings are as follows:
The "Family" and "Gaming" categories have the most apps in the store.
In the Play Store, 92% of apps are free, while 8% are premium.
I Am Rich- Trump Edition is the priciest app, costing $400!.
The overall sentiment score for the combined dataset is 64% positive, 22% negative, and 13% neutral.
File Commander is the top-ranked business App in the top ten categories, based on this dataset.
The majority of apps have average ratings of 4.3 or higher.
